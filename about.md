SAMMI, the Substance Abuse Management Modeling Initiative, seeks to collaborate with health care providers, subject matter experts, and political leaders to provide decision makers with evidence-based support for policy and resource allocation decisions regarding substance abuse. A state-based model of opioid addiction will allow us to demonstrate the effectiveness of various interventions on the substance abuse crisis.

Project SAMMI is focused on a data driven system model of the opioid epidemic that will take into account drug sources, abuse pathways, substance costs, response program costs, the care landscape, and patient outcomes, with the ultimate goal of reducing the harm from substance abuse in Massachusetts. 

MITRE (SAMMI's founding member) will develop a conceptual model of substance abuse, and enumerate expected populations in the state of Massachusetts based on data made available by governmental/other sources. This model and data will be presented via an interactive system to allow stakeholders to investigate trends and funding choices. Eventually, this model and system will be generalized to be applicable to other locations, given the availability of the necessary data.
