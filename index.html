  <p>Project SAMMI, the Substance Abuse Management Modeling Initiative, is an effort to combat the opioid abuse epidemic by bringing together data and people who can act on it. Data analysts, clinicians, and policymakers can leverage existing sources of information to make informed choices about how to spend limited dollars.</p>

  <p>In 2014, more than 1200 people are estimated to have died from unintentional opioid overdoses in the state of Massachusetts, <a href="http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/docs/dph/quality/drugcontrol/county-level-pmp/data-brief-aug-2015-overdose-county.pdf">according to the Department of Public Health</a>. This is more than triple the rate in the state in 2000.</p>

  <p>You can view a model of opioid substance abuse developed by SAMMI <a href="{{site.url}}/data/2015/12/05/the-model.html">here</a>, and view a list of data sources being used by the project <a href="{{site.url}}/data/2015/11/27/data-sources.html">here</a>.</p>
